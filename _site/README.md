Hello world. I have long thought and talked about making a personal website. Not sure why I've put it off for so long. So I am going to document every step to make it super-duper easy for anyone that wants to make a personal website like this. My current plan is that this will be an art portfolio/creative website! Exciting!

Step 0:
Create a repository on GitHub and git clone.

Step 1:
Frantically learn different options for layout. After discussing with friend Emily Hong, I decide on Andrew Fong's Jekyll theme, [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/about). I then [download it](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) from GiHub. Then I tinkered with some of the files for testing. Now I will publish on gh-pages to see results and go from there.

Step 2:
Confirm that basic setup works ok. Haha, I had misspelled my name! (Site is now hosted here: https://veronicanutting.github.io/vin/) Next, onboard sister on GitHub and using same barebones personal website.

Now that it's basically set up ok and I've been able to quickly reproduce steps 1-3, I'm going to just generally use this space for quick notes.
* Seems like md and html files both work, probably best to only use md for simplest ones (??)
* Ahh would be so cool to say something like, Welcome to my website you are the ith visitor. I guess that's one of the downsides of simpler, static websites.
* Now I think I'm going to do most of my building locally, running 'bundle exec jekyll serve' in my commandline.
